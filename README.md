# Installation

* There is no separate installation to be done to run this website. If you want to run this on your local machine after cloning it, then run the following commands.

    ```
    npm i
    ```

* Also, please ensure that your `.env.EXAMPLE` file is renamed to `.env` and content filled out with your postgresSQL user / password. Secret key can be choice of your own.
    ```
    DB_NAME='tech_db'
    DB_USER=''
    DB_PASSWORD=''
    DB_SECRET_KEY=''
    ```

* Next step is to run your postgres in the terminal and run the schema.sql file.

    ```
    psql -U postgres
    ```

    - enter your credential to login to postgres and then run the following commands in order

        ```postgres
        \i db/schema.sql
        ```
    - to exit postgres :
        ```
        \q
        ```

* Once installation is done for npm pacakages, you may run the terminal program by running the following command at root of the project:

    ```
    node server.js
    ```
